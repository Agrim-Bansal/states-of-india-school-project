            Jana Gana Mana is the national anthem of India. It was originally composed as Bharoto Bhagyo 
            Bidhata in Bengali by polymath Rabindranath Tagore. The first stanza of the song Bharoto 
            Bhagyo Bidhata was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India as the National Anthem on
            24 January 1950. A formal rendition of the national anthem takes approximately 52 seconds. 
            It was first publicly sung on 27 December 1911 at the Calcutta Session of the Indian National 
            Congress.

        <font color="#5e1990" size=5>
            India is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.
            All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry 
            and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and 
            governments. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the
            central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States
            Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis. There are over
            a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.
